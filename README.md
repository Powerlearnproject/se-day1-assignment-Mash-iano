Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
   software engineering is the application of engineering principles and methods to design,develop and maintain high quality software designs
   in the technology industry it helps in creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication and healthcare
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   They include development of programming languages such as C, establishment of software engineering as a discipline which took place in 1960's, the emergence of structured programming which hapenned in 
   1970's and lastly the rise of efficient methodologies which took place in 2000's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Requirements-involves gathering and documenting the system requirements and the user needs 
    Design-coming up with high level and detailed design of user interface and software architecture 
    Implementation-writing the code and building the software according to the design 
    Testing-conducting a number of tests to ensure software meets quality standards and requirements
    Deployment-releasing for use by users 
    Maintenance-involves provision of ongoing support, updates and improvements to the software
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Waterfall methodolgy is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall for example staring with requierments, going to design, to implementation, to testing ,to deployment 
   and lastly maintenance while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibilty, ccollaborations and response to change 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Software developer- rights codes and implements software solutions
   Quality assurance engineer-designs and executes test plans for ensuring software quality
   Project manager-oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   IDEs provide comprehensive tools and for writing, debugging and testing code such as Visual Studio and Eclipse 
   VCS help track changes to source code and coordination of work among the team members such as Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   Tight deadlines where they are pressured to deliver on schedule and this can be solved by beginning work as early as possible and prioritization of task
   Technical debt which accrue from shortcut solutions this can be solved by avoiding such debt 
   Change of requirements which can cause project delay which is solved by effective communication


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Unit testing which involves testing individual components or modules of software
   Integration testing where we test interactions between different components
   System test where the whole system is tested 
   Acceptance testing where the sysytem is tested against the user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting questions or statements to get best possible results from AI models
   it helps avoid confusing answers from AI models by making questions clear and specific 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   vague - "Tell me about technology"
   improved- "Write me a 1000 character article explainign how technology has all round affected human life with it continued improvement"
   the improved prompt is clear and concise
